# List of WYSIWYG editors

My requirements:

* open source (not GPL or AGPL)
* easy to use is more important than many fancy features
* No need to support old browsers. IE11 is dead.

Good:

* https://xdsoft.net/jodit/ (supports tables), MIT License, looks good. But menu on top (inline menu like editor.js is more clean)
* https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js (Apache License) Nice TAB feature. With tables. Nice inline menu. Currently my favorite

Something is missing:
* https://github.com/basecamp/trix (MIT License, from Basecamp, the creators of Ruby on Rails, no tables). No more much development: [graph](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/graphs/contributors)
* https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce (oldest, LGPL, 21k commits. Started 2006. too old)
* https://quilljs.com/ no tables [dev staled](https://github.com/quilljs/quill/graphs/contributors)
* https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/ ([License](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/blob/master/LICENSE.md) LGPL, compatible with closed source code. But future is unclear)
* https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/ ([License](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/blob/master/LICENSE.md) GPL, not compatible with closed source code)
* https://github.com/facebook/draft-js (from Facebook, but no tables support)
* https://www.draftail.org/ (used by [wagtail](https://wagtail.io/)). No support for tables. Based on Draft.js
* https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate (can show, but not edit tables. See [tables Example](https://www.slatejs.org/examples/tables)) [Why We Moved From Quill to Slate](https://medium.com/the-lead/why-we-moved-from-quill-to-slate-94f42aa54fec)
* https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/ Editor of WordPress. But AFAIK can't be used outside Wordpress
* https://summernote.org/ (supports tables, but only limited. Started 2013)

* https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor/graphs/contributors no progress in the last year
