# List of WYSIWYG editors

Good:

* https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/ ([License](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/blob/master/LICENSE.md) LGPL, compatible with closed source code)
* https://xdsoft.net/jodit/ (supports tables), MIT License, looks good. Current favorite.
* https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce (oldest, LGPL, 21k commits. Started 2006)
* https://github.com/matthiask/django-content-editor (based on CKEditor4)
* https://github.com/basecamp/trix (MIT License, from Basecamp, the creators of Ruby on Rails, no tables)

* https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate (can show, but not edit tables. See [tables Example](https://www.slatejs.org/examples/tables)) [Why We Moved From Quill to Slate](https://medium.com/the-lead/why-we-moved-from-quill-to-slate-94f42aa54fec)
* https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/ Editor of WordPress. But AFAIK can't be used outside Wordpress
